# Task 5: Data Science Text Classification

## Overview

This repository contains the solution for Task 5 of the Kaiburr Assessment 2025: **Multi-Class Text Classification on the Consumer Complaint Dataset** using modern machine learning techniques.

***

## Dataset

- **Location:** `input/rows.csv`
- **Description:** Contains over one million rows of real-world consumer complaints about various financial products and services in the US.
- **Selected Columns:** 
    - `Product` (category label)
    - `Consumer complaint narrative` (complaint text)

***

## Solution Approach

### 1. Data Loading & Preprocessing

- Loaded dataset and selected key columns.
- Dropped rows with missing complaint text for data cleanliness.
- Merged similar categories to reduce ambiguity.
- Final curated dataset: ~380,000 complaints across 13 categories.

### 2. Feature Engineering

- Converted complaint texts into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF**.
- Provided models a representation to learn from text patterns.

- Compared multiple algorithms:
    - Linear SVM
    - Random Forest
    - Multinomial Naive Bayes
    - Logistic Regression
- Used 75/25 train-test split for evaluation.

### 4. Model Evaluation

- Reported **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**.
- Visualized confusion matrix to analyze class-wise performance.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Place dataset as `input/rows.csv`.
3. Open `multi-class-text-classification-tfidf.ipynb` with Jupyter/Kaggle.
4. Run all cells to reproduce results.

***

## Result Highlights

- Highest accuracy for frequent complaint categories.
- Key confusions among similar financial product categories.
- Models generalize well on previously unseen complaints.
